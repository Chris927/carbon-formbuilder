## Intro

This package facilitates creating web forms, by using a small'ish configuration to define form fields, their types and other properties. It makes building forms faster and with  better quality, therefore it's a form builder :)

Forms created via this form builder work with [React](https://reactjs.org/).
The form builder uses [Formik](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formik) to manage form state; the user of the form builder (you) may remain oblivious to that.


### Installation

Let's assume you've installed React and its peer dependencies previously:

```bash static
npm install react react-dom
```

... then you can install formbuilder together with its peer dependencies:

```bash static
npm install u5-carbon-formbuilder carbon-components \
  carbon-components-react carbon-icons u5-carbon-components-react \
  formik
```

See also [the NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/u5-carbon-formbuilder).
